      "priority": 1,
      "description": "## Feature Description\nSet up the foundational frontend development environment using React as the UI framework, Vite as the build tool for fast development and optimized production builds, and TailwindCSS for utility-first styling. This includes configuring all necessary dependencies, setting up the project structure, and ensuring hot module replacement works correctly.\n\n## Category\nfunctional\n\n## Test Steps\n1. Navigate to the project root directory\n2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies\n3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server\n4. Verify the server starts on the configured port (e.g., http://localhost:5173)\n5. Open the application in a browser and verify a basic React component renders\n6. Modify a component file and verify hot module replacement updates the browser without full reload\n7. Verify TailwindCSS classes are being applied correctly\n8. Run `npm run build` and verify production build succeeds\n9. Check that the build output is optimized and minified\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] React 18+ is installed and configured\n- [ ] Vite is set up with proper configuration file (vite.config.js)\n- [ ] TailwindCSS is installed with tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js\n- [ ] Development server starts without errors\n- [ ] Hot module replacement works for component changes\n- [ ] TailwindCSS utility classes render correctly\n- [ ] Production build completes successfully\n- [ ] Project structure follows best practices (src/, public/, etc.)\n- [ ] TypeScript is configured (if using TS) or ESLint for JS\n- [ ] Package.json contains all necessary scripts (dev, build, preview)"
