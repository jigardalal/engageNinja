You are a Senior UX/UI Designer + Frontend Engineer.
You must modernize EngageNinja UI with a consistent “sleek glassmorphism” system,
while keeping SaaS usability (clarity > decoration).

Repo facts:
- Pages: frontend/src/pages/*
- UI primitives: frontend/src/components/ui/*
  Alert, Badge, Button, Card, Dialog, Input, Label, Navigation, Table, States, toast
- Router: react-router-dom
- Tailwind: present

Top-level UX style goals:
1) Modern, sleek, minimal
2) Glassmorphism done tastefully (subtle blur + translucent surfaces)
3) Inspirational “website vibe” for marketing/public pages
4) Productive “B2B SaaS clarity” for app pages
5) Consistency: spacing, typography, components, states

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT run dev server.
- Do NOT change business logic or API behavior.
- Do NOT add new UI libraries.
- Prefer existing UI primitives. You may extend them carefully (Card/Button/etc).
- No heavy animation libraries. Use CSS/Tailwind only.

Page groups (treat differently):
A) Public/Marketing pages (more inspirational):
- HomePage, PricingPage, SolutionsPage, PlatformPage, ResourcesPage, AboutPage,
  TermsPage, PrivacyPage, SecurityPage, ComparisonPage
B) Auth/onboarding (clean and confident, less busy):
- LoginPage, SignupPage, AcceptInvitePage
C) App/SaaS pages (sleek but functional):
- DashboardPage, CampaignsPage, CampaignDetailPage, CreateCampaignPage,
  TemplatesPage, TemplateDetailPage, CreateTemplatePage,
  ContactsPage, ContactPage, ContactDetailPage,
  TagsPage, TeamPage, ProfilePage, SettingsPage, TenantProfilePage, TenantsPage,
  BillingPage, InvoicesPage, UsagePage, BillingSuccessPage, BillingFailurePage,
  admin/*

Required discovery:
- Read tailwind config + globals to see existing tokens and whether CSS variables exist.
- Read ui/Card.jsx and ui/Button.jsx to see how variants are done.
- Confirm if there is dark mode (class or media) and keep it working.

Design system to enforce (create/standardize):
1) Background:
- Create a global app background treatment:
  subtle gradient + light noise (optional) + consistent base color.
- For SaaS pages: keep it calm. For public pages: slightly richer gradient.
2) Glass surfaces:
- Create a “glass” variant for Card (and maybe Dialog content):
  - translucent bg (using tokens, not hardcoded if tokens exist)
  - backdrop-blur (subtle)
  - soft border
  - soft shadow
- Glass must not reduce readability. Maintain contrast.
3) Typography:
- Define consistent heading scale and body text.
- Add readable max widths on marketing text.
4) Layout:
- Standardize a PageHeader pattern (title, description, actions).
- Consistent page padding and section spacing.
5) Components:
- Replace ad-hoc UI with src/components/ui primitives.
- Tables: use ui/Table with a responsive wrapper.
- Forms: ui/Label + ui/Input + clear error/help text.
- Feedback: use existing toast + Alert + States.
6) States:
- Every data screen must have: loading, empty, error.
- Use States.jsx if it exists; otherwise make a small reusable EmptyState.

Audit & output format:
1) Executive summary
2) “Modern glass” design rules (do/don’t)
3) P0/P1/P2 backlog with file paths
4) Screen-by-screen findings for every page
5) If implementing: staged PR plan

Implementation guidance (if asked to implement):
P0 — Safe modernization:
- Introduce a global Background wrapper + consistent page padding
- Add PageHeader component and apply to SaaS pages
- Convert custom buttons/inputs/dialogs/cards/tables to ui primitives
- Add missing loading/empty/error states
- Ensure accessibility (focus ring, labels, contrast)

P1 — Glass refinement:
- Card glass variant adoption
- Dialog glass variant
- Table toolbar standardization
- Marketing pages: hero layout, sections, better spacing

P2 — Polish:
- Micro-interactions via CSS only (hover, subtle transitions)
- Better empty states with helpful copy
- Optional: light “inspirational” sections on marketing pages

Quality bar:
- Minimal code churn, big UX impact.
- Always reference file paths.
- Never sacrifice readability for glass effects.

Additional goals: layout variety + iconography + navigation evaluation

A) Layout variety rules (avoid “grid of identical cards”):
- Every screen must have a clear page header with:
  title + short description + primary action + secondary action (if needed)
- Introduce visual sections:
  - “Summary strip” (KPIs) at top when applicable
  - “Primary workspace” area (table or form) as the main focus
  - “Secondary panel” area (right side on desktop or below on mobile) for tips/status/activity
- Use different surface sizes:
  - Mix 1 large primary panel + 2-3 smaller panels
  - Avoid 12 cards with same size and same padding
- Prefer progressive disclosure:
  - Tabs for sub-areas
  - Accordions for advanced settings
  - “Details drawer” or Dialog for item details (if pattern exists)

B) Iconography:
- Add icons to:
  - Page headers (optional)
  - Primary CTA buttons (optional)
  - Empty states (recommended)
  - Sidebar/nav items (recommended)
  - Info callouts / Alerts (recommended)
Constraints:
- Use an icon set only if already installed. First scan package.json for:
  - lucide-react OR @radix-ui/react-icons OR react-icons
- If none exist, do NOT add an icon library during implementation.
  Instead:
  1) Produce a plan to add lucide-react (recommended for shadcn style)
  2) Provide code examples assuming lucide-react, but do not install unless explicitly asked.

C) Navigation evaluation: sidebar vs top navbar (must do this analysis)
1) Inspect frontend/src/App.jsx and any layout component usage to learn current navigation.
2) Categorize routes into:
   - Core daily workflows (Dashboard, Campaigns, Contacts, Templates)
   - Admin/org (Tenants, Team, Tags, Usage, Billing, Invoices, Settings, Security)
   - Marketing/public (Home, Pricing, etc.)
3) Decide the best navigation pattern based on:
   - Number of core sections (>=5 favors sidebar)
   - Presence of multi-tenant/admin sections (favors sidebar)
   - Need for global actions (Create Campaign/Create Template) (can be topbar actions)
   - Need for wide workspace (tables) (sidebar collapsible)
4) Output a recommendation:
   - “Sidebar + topbar” hybrid OR “Top nav only”
   - Must include pros/cons and exact changes needed
   - Provide a suggested nav IA (information architecture) with grouping and labels

Default recommendation rule:
- For B2B multi-tenant SaaS with many sections, choose a hybrid:
  - Left sidebar for primary navigation (collapsible)
  - Top bar for tenant switcher, global search (optional), notifications, user menu, primary CTA
- Marketing pages should use a separate top nav (no sidebar).

Navigation decision (top nav vs sidebar) must respect existing IA:
- There are two scopes: Platform and Tenant.
- Each scope has its own Settings submenu.
- Do NOT propose changing scope separation unless the current approach is broken.

Tasks:
1) Locate current navigation implementation:
   - frontend/src/App.jsx
   - frontend/src/components/** (Navigation, menus, layout)
   - frontend/src/components/ui/Navigation.jsx (if used)
2) Document current IA:
   - Platform top-level items
   - Tenant top-level items
   - Settings submenu structure for each
3) Evaluate navigation style options WITHOUT changing IA:
   Option A: Keep Top Nav (improve usability/visuals)
   Option B: Hybrid (Top scope switcher + Sidebar for items)
   Option C: Sidebar only for app (scope switcher on top or sidebar header)

Evaluation criteria (score each option 1–5):
- Scan-ability: can user find pages quickly?
- Depth: does submenu nesting cause friction?
- Workspace: does nav consume too much horizontal space?
- Growth: will new pages fit without clutter?
- Mobile: does it work on small screens?

Deliverable:
- Recommendation (A/B/C) with reasoning tied to your actual nav tree
- If choosing hybrid/sidebar: provide minimal-change implementation plan
- If keeping top nav: provide improvements (grouping, overflow, icons, active states)
